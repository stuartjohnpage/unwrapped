# Unwrapped Product Roadmap

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Unwrapped
- **Project Description**: Unwrapped is an application designed to streamline gift-giving in large families, particularly around Christmas time
- **Primary User Persona**: A family who have trouble not duplicating gifts
- **Problem Statement**: My family finds it hard to not duplicate gifts. It would be easier if we could roughly see what people are getting other people, but also it is critical that that person cannot see what they are being given.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Basic Event Creation and Invitation (2 Weeks)

- Allow users to sign up and create an account
- Build event creation functionality
- Implement event invitation feature
- Enable users to invite family members to events

### Milestone 2: Gift Selection and Visibility (3 Weeks)

- Develop the ability for users to indicate what gift they are giving someone
- Implement visibility settings to allow viewing of others' gift selections except for the respective recipients
- Enable users to view gifts selected by other family members

### Milestone 3: Duplicate Gift Prevention (2 Weeks)

- Implement a duplicate gift prevention mechanism
- Provide users with real-time feedback to avoid purchasing duplicative gifts

### Milestone 4: User Experience Enhancements (2 Weeks)

- Improve the overall user interface and experience based on user feedback
- Enhance event management features, including editing and deleting events
- Incorporate user suggestions for additional features or improvements

## Next Steps

Based on the roadmap above, the next steps for the Unwrapped project would be to:

1. Kick-off Milestone 1 - Basic Event Creation and Invitation.
2. Collaborate with the development team to design and implement the required features.
3. Conduct user testing and gather feedback to refine the functionality of the application.
4. Once Milestone 1 is completed, move on to Milestone 2 - Gift Selection and Visibility.
5. Iterate and repeat steps 2 and 3 for each subsequent milestone until all milestones are completed.
6. Continuously monitor user feedback and make updates as necessary.

## Conclusion

The Unwrapped product roadmap outlines the key milestones and steps required to develop the application. By addressing the problem statement and focusing on the needs of the target users, Unwrapped will streamline gift-giving in large families and provide a seamless experience for managing events and gift selections.
